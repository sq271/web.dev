<p class='small'>This pastebin clone was written with Django 1.7 and Python 3.4<br /><br />

This is just the beginning of the project. I hope to soon implement new features and get it up and hosting. <br /><br />

My immediate goals are to add expiration times for pastes and a server side clean up script. <br /><br />
